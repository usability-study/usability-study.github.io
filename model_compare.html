    <h3>How to use this tool</h3>
    <p>
        Select a site from the dropdown in the bottom left. The chart will 
        update to show all model predictions for that site, as well as some
        metrics about the model performance on that particular site in the 
        table below. 
        <br><br>
        Hover over the lines to show model predictions at that point. Zoom and 
        pan by scrolling and clicking + dragging. Double click anywhere on the 
        line chart to go back to original zoom.
    </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> 
        As we described in the  
        <a href="/ch4cast/about">about page</a>, we set aside several 
        FLUXNET sites for model testing. None of the models were trained on 
        this data, and only once we had finalized our three models did we 
        use them to make predictions on the test data. Therefore, the 
        predictions based on this data are the best indicators we have of model 
        performance. 
        <br><br> 
        Because we eliminated any gaps larger than two months
        from the data, some FLUXNET sites were split into multiple, continuous
        time series. The site IDs available here reflect the original FLUXNET 
        site ID, with an underscore and an integer appended to indicate which
        of the continuous time series within that site it is. For example, 
        "BR-Npw_0" is the first continous time series for the "BR-Npw" 
        FLUXNET site, and "BR-Npw_1" is the second.
